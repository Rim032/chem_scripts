## ChemScripts
### Description

A small collection of light-weight and versatile Python scripts useful in the application of general chemistry. They can automatically balance a given chemical equation, and calculate the molecular weight of any given compound.

### Reason

I had some free time away from my research laboratory and work. So, upon using C and Python again, I decided to develop and release these scripts for any general chemistry students to use and experiment with.  

### Misc.

Note: This collection may or may not continue to be expanded on.
